## Challenges & Learnings

### Responsive Breakpoints
Creating a truly responsive design required careful planning of breakpoints and media queries. I learned to prioritize mobile-first design and progressively enhance for larger screens, ensuring consistent user experience across all devices.

### Animation Performance
Balancing smooth animations with performance was challenging. I optimized CSS transitions and JavaScript event listeners to prevent layout thrashing, using `requestAnimationFrame` where appropriate for smoother 60fps animations.

### Vanilla JavaScript Architecture
Building without frameworks taught me the importance of clean code organization and modular JavaScript patterns. I implemented efficient DOM manipulation and event delegation to maintain performance as the application grew.

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
Ensuring consistent behavior across different browsers required thorough testing and fallback strategies. I learned to use progressive enhancement and feature detection to provide graceful degradation for older browsers.

## Outcome

The portfolio website was successfully completed as a personal project and serves as a professional showcase of frontend development skills. It demonstrates the ability to create polished, performant web experiences using modern vanilla web technologies without relying on heavy frameworks.
